about_heading: My mission during this life…
about_bio: "There came a point in my life where I was at my lowest, something changed, it drove me forge a sincere and intimate connection with my inner spirit; to reconnect more profoundly with my soul. It all started one afternoon after tea with a friend. I jumped into researching natural healing, yoga, meditation, and all that is found within the world of spiritual healing and guidance. Then one thing led to the next; it was a like light or a sign that I was asking for. I felt this urge and push to move forward and explore the beautiful world of energy healing. I started with Reiki sessions along with meditation and yoga classes. This new way of being completely changed my mindset and outlook on life. Little by little I began to feel different, connected with nature and a true profound desire to be one with nature. I found healing on an emotional and physical level as well as a spiritual connection. I understood finally why I was here and what my calling was and my mission during this life. I then went on to pursue my Reiki training as well as other energy work and numerology. I am currently pursuing a new energy training in Essenian and Egyptian therapies along with my professional intuitive numerology certification.<br><br> Supporting people is a passion that nourishes my soul; and sharing my story and listening to yours frees my mind. My whole being is driven by a deep dedication to energy healing. I would be overjoyed to connect with you."
