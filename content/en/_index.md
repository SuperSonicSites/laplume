about_heading: My mission during this life…
about_bio: "Have you ever felt like you had “it all figured out”? And then unexpectedly you receive a wake-up call and suddenly you are back to square one, back to the drawing board. As if you are trailing along the path we call life, which ultimately doesn’t seem to be as you aspired or projected for yourself.<br><br>There came a point in my life where I was at my lowest, something changed, it drove me forge a sincere and intimate connection with my inner spirit; to reconnect more profoundly with my soul. It all started one afternoon after tea with a friend, which then led me research for natural healing, yoga, meditation, and all that is connected to spiritual healing and guidance. Then one thing led to the next; it was a like light or a sign that I was asking for. I felt this urge and push to move forward and explore the beautiful world of energy healing. I started with Reiki sessions along with meditation and yoga classes, this new way of being, completely changed my mindset and outlook on life. I began to feel different, connected with nature and a true profound desire to be one with nature. I found healing on an emotional, physical level as well as spiritual connection. I understood finally why I was here and what my calling was and my mission during this life. I continued to pursue my Reiki training as well as other energy work and numerology. Today I am pursuing a new energy training in Essenian and Egyptian therapies.<br><br>My passion to help others is what feeds my soul, my desire to share my story and hear yours is what frees my spirit. My devotion to energy work is what my fuels mind.<br><br>Namaste<br><br>"
