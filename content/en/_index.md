As if you are trailing along the path we call life, which ultimately doesn’t seem to be as you aspired or projected for yourself.<br><br>There came a point in my life where I was at my lowest, something changed, it drove me forge a sincere and intimate connection with my inner spirit; to reconnect more profoundly with my soul. It all started one afternoon after tea with a friend, which then led me research for natural healing, yoga, meditation, and all that is connected to spiritual healing and guidance. Then one thing led to the next; it was a like light or a sign that I was asking for. I felt this urge and push to move forward and explore the beautiful world of energy healing. I started with Reiki sessions along with meditation and yoga classes, this new way of being, completely changed my mindset and outlook on life. I began to feel different, connected with nature and a true profound desire to be one with nature. I found healing on an emotional, physical level as well as spiritual connection. I understood finally why I was here and what my calling was and my mission during this life. I continued to pursue my Reiki training as well as other energy work and numerology. Today I am pursuing a new energy training in Essenian and Egyptian therapies.<br><br>My passion to help others is what feeds my soul, my desire to share my story and hear yours is what frees my spirit.
